# Cooperative_Coverage_For_Surveillance_Of_3D_Structures

The python file provided implements the algorithm of the paper "Cooperative coverage for surveillance of 3D structures".

It simulates an autonomous multirobot system to cover and surveil a 3D structure (A cylinder in this case).
You only have to download it, and play with the parameters, the rest is already done.
