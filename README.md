# Cooperative Coverage For Surveillance Of 3D Structures

The python file provided implements the algorithm of the paper [Cooperative coverage for surveillance of 3D structures](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8205999).

It simulates an autonomous multirobot system to cover and surveil a 3D structure (A cylinder in this case).
You only have to download it, and play with the parameters, the rest is already done.
