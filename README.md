# Cooperative Coverage For Surveillance Of 3D Structures

The python file provided implements the algorithm of the paper [Cooperative coverage for surveillance of 3D structures](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8205999).

It simulates an autonomous multirobot system to cover and surveil a 3D structure (a cylinder in this case).
You only have to download it, and play with the parameters, the rest is already done.

The landmarks are distributed randomly along the surface of the cylinder (we used 150 landmarks).
The landmarks and the initial positions and orientations of the robots are represented in the image, where each landmark has assigned a robot and they are randomly and equitatively assigned:
